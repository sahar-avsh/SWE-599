# SWE-599
This repository has been made for SWE 599(final project) of [Boğaziçi University](http://www.boun.edu.tr/en_US), master of [software engineering](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/tr/graduate/swe). 
SWE 599 has been designed as the final project for software engineering students. My topic is regarded as 'A collaborative Learning Platform', mentored by Professor [Suzan Uskudarlı](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/tr/people/suzan.uskudarli).

'A collaborative Learning Platform' is about a website designed for people who are interested in learning for the sake of it, not those who seek diplomas or achievements. On this platform people can attach their resources and follow them on their own pace without losing them.
